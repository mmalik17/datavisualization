## Dashboard 1: Renewable Energy Overview in Europe
This visualization dashboard is created based on the data from Ember climate organization that I found from MakeOver Monday challenge. It shows the trend of renewable energy generation in Europe, country ranking, and portion of energy source generation. The main insight is during 2010-2020, the portion/share of renewable energy generation in Europe is getting higher while the fossil fuel generation is getting lower. 

Beside showing the data over Europe, I also provide the data of trend and portion in every single country in Europe. To access that, just click the dropdown between the word ‘Area’.
